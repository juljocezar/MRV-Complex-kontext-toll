# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This repository contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1ZyTGO917OocFkHsbn9BhaK47QO_9PJjT

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later is recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    *   Create a new file named `.env.local` by copying the example file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env.local
        ```
    *   Open `.env.local` and add your Gemini API key.

4.  **How to get a Gemini API key:**
    *   Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
    *   Click on **"Get API key"** in the top left corner.
    *   Create a new API key in a new or existing Google Cloud project.
    *   Copy the key and paste it into `.env.local`.

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
